## Overview

Testthis provides utility functions and RStudio addins for common
package development tasks:

  - `test_this()`: Reloads the package and runs tests associated with
    the currently open R script file.
  - `test_with_skip()`: Like `devtools::test()`, but does not run test
    files that contain the line `#' @skip`. This function is deprecated
    and will eventually be removed. If you do find this feature useful
    and do not want to see it gone, please file an issue.
  - `open_testfile()`: Opens the associated testfile in an editor
    window. If the currently open file already is a testfile, it opens
    the associated file in the `/R` directory. Can be used to jump back
    and forth between both.

It further provides functions for managing subdirectories of the
`tests/testthat` directory of a package:

  - `use_testdata()` places a single R object in the
    `tests/testhat/testdata` directory. It is analoguous to
    `usethis::use_data()`, except that it saves the Object in the `.rds`
    format, which is more convenient for single R Objects than `.rda` or
    `.Rdata` (see `?readRDS`).
  - `use_testdata_raw()` creates the directory
    `tests/testhat/testdata-raw`. Use this directory to put scripts that
    generate the data in `tests/testhat/testdata`.
  - `read_testdata()` is a simple wrapper for `readRDS()` to read files
    in `tests/testhat/testdata`.
  - `use_test_subdir()` and `test_subdir()` for putting/running tests in
    subdirectories of `tests/testhat/`. These tests will *not* be run on
    CRAN or by `devtools::test()`.

Testthis also provides the experimental feature `get_test_coverage()`.
In contrast to the popular [covr](https://github.com/r-lib/covr)
package, this does *not* calculate the coverage automatically. It rather
requires you to put special comment tags in your test-source files. You
can use it like a todo/checklist.

## Installation

    # Testthis is on CRAN:
    install.packages("testthis")
    
    # You can also install the development version from GitHub:
    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("s-fleck/testthis")

## Usage

``` 

library(testthis)

open_testfile()  # can be assigned to a hotkey
## The file `tests/testthat/test_README.Rmd` does not exist. 
## You can create it with testthis::test_skeleton().

test_skeleton()
## * Creating `tests/testthat/test_myscript.R`

open_testfile()
## > Opens `tests/testthat/test_myscript.R` (in RStudio)

test_this()  # can be assigned to a hotkey
## > Runs tests in `tests/testthat/test_myscript.R` (in RStudio,)
## > works from the original .R file as well as from the file containing the tests
```
